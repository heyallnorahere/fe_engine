# fe_engine [![build](https://github.com/yodasoda1219/fe_engine/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yodasoda1219/fe_engine/actions/workflows/build.yml)
## About
This project aims to recreate the Fire Emblem: Three Houses game engine in a terminal. The gameplay side, I mean.
## What's this Fire Emblem?
Fire Emblem is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. The premise of each map is that you (the player) have a set of units (your army) and need to defeat the enemy's army, controlled by the game's AI. Each unit has a set amount of HP, and once that HP count reaches zero, they die, and once you lose a unit, it's gone from later maps.
## Building
There should be a script for supported platforms named (platform)-genprojects.(extension). Run that to generate build files, and then build the project files like normal. This project runs on [Premake 5](https://premake.github.io).

## About
This project aims to recreate the Fire Emblem: Three Houses game engine. All game mechanics are referenced from [this website](https://fe3h.com/).
## What's this Fire Emblem?
Fire Emblem is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. The premise of each map is that you (the player) have a set of units (your army) and need to defeat the enemy's army, controlled by the game's AI. Each unit has a set amount of HP, and once that HP count reaches zero, they die, and once you lose a unit, it's gone from later maps.

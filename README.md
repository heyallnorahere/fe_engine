## About
This project aims to recreate the Fire Emblem: Three Houses game engine in a terminal. The gameplay side, I mean.
## Building
There should be a script for supported platforms named (platform)-genprojects.(extension). Run that to generate build files, and then build the project files like normal. This project runs on [Premake](https://premake.github.io) 5.

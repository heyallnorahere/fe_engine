    FEEngine is written in C#, and requires version 9.0. Therefore, it can only be built on Windows, as of writing this document. (June 3, 2021)
    <br>
    Requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2019</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/">Mono</a> (x86 or x64, depending on which architecture you wish to build for)</li>
    </ul>
    Once you have pulled the source, run "windows-genprojects.bat" to generate build files. Then build the C# and C++ projects like normal.
